# Stack
- Set up a Django endpoint that you can ping
- Use multiprocessing in Python to simultaneously iterate over different flush selections
- Have some data structure of "all valid histograms"
- Make a website where you can play the game

# Algorithm
- Precompute all valid histograms and store them into a tree
- Enumerate over flush picks, and travel the tree for each remaining set to see if it works
